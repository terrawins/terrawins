# Hi there 👋
## I'm Edwin! 

## About Me 🚀
I'm a programmer with a penchant for tinkering with small microcontrollers in my spare time. By day, I'm an apprentice in event technology, where I seamlessly blend my programming skills into the world of LED art installations. Whether it's controlling tubes or cubes using DMX, I'm always exploring the intersection of technology and creativity.

## Projects 💡
One of my most cherished projects involves transforming a vintage phone with an integrated Teensy-Microcontroller. This unique creation serves as a standalone device in art exhibitions, ringing at random intervals. Curious souls who answer are greeted with pre-recorded messages and can leave their own by navigating options on the buttons. Exciting plans are in the works to enhance this with a Pi Zero soon!

## Coding Adventures 🛠️
As I delve into microcontrollers and unravel the mysteries of Python, I'm on a quest to become proficient enough to share my work confidently. Currently in the learning phase, I might be a bit shy, but I'm eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts as I grow in my coding skills.

## What's Next? ⚡
I'm embarking on the journey of learning Python, and I can't wait to unravel the possibilities it holds. In the pipeline, I'm gearing up for another intriguing telephone project, this time with a Pi Zero. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore and bring my coding ideas to life and hopfully share them soon 😄
